# BasicBiostat_S2016
This repo contains the entire R code to reproduce the results given in the stata log files that are distributed during the Basic Biostatistic PhD-code at Aarhus University in spring 2016. 
The data, stata log files, the exercises and much more can be found at http://www.biostat.au.dk/teaching/postgraduat.htm

I am by no means a programmer or a statistician so I expect that some of the code can be done more efficiently than what I propose. I am happy to recieve any comments and suggestions at eiset@ph.au.dk.

Enjoy
/Andreas
