# UPDATE: Below is an example using the haven package by Mr. Wickham et al. to load .dta files
# (as generated in Stata). Contrary to the foreign package this will also load .dta
# files saved in Stata 13 and 14 (see comment below). Use the same procedure as below (for
# the foreign package) substituting read.dta with read_dta.

# If you do not want to download and convert all the Stata files this method can be used. 
# You may have to do some recoding in the Exercises.R file.
# NOTICE: As of July 2016 this will not work with dta-files saved in Stata 13 or 14 files.
# Alternatives are: (in Stata 13 or 14) Save as Stata 12 or older or (in R) use Hadley's haven
# package with function read_dta: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/haven.pdf

library(foreign)
dtaurl <- file.path("[path/of/dta/file]", "[name_of_file.dta]") 
dta <- read.dta(dtaurl)

# Example with albumin data set
library(foreign)
dtaurl <- file.path("http://www.biostat.au.dk/teaching/basicbiostat/files", "albumin.dta")
dta <- read.dta(dtaurl)
